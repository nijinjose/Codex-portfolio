Here are some of the projects I've worked on.

{% include projects.html %}

<!-- 
To add projects:
1. Create markdown files in the `_projects` directory (e.g., `_projects/my-cool-project.md`).
2. Add YAML front matter to each file (title, description, repository, date, image, etc.).
   See al-folio documentation for details.
