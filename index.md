# Nijin Jose

I'm a Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer focused on building and deploying production-grade AI systems. My work spans predictive modeling, MLOps, and AI infrastructure - with a particular interest in making models that actually work in real-world environments.

## 2023 - Present

Currently, I'm a **Senior Data Science and MLOps Analyst** at Markerstudy Group in London. I lead the development of production ML systems for risk prediction in insurance, with a focus on gradient boosting models and robust MLOps practices. We've delivered tangible business value (120K GBP annual revenue uplift) through a combination of model improvements and infrastructure modernization.

## 2022 - 2023

As an **Associate Consultant** at Capgemini Invent, I worked on ML infrastructure and model monitoring for major clients including Michelin. I engineered image processing pipelines, implemented drift detection frameworks, and developed MLOps best practices that guided Fortune 500 companies in their AI journey.

## 2021 - 2022

At **ITTStar Consulting**, I built predictive models using AWS HealthLake for insurance applications and developed computer vision solutions with Amazon Rekognition (82% detection accuracy) for retail inventory management.

## Tech I Work With

- **ML/DL**: scikit-learn, LightGBM, XGBoost, PyTorch, Computer Vision, NLP
- **MLOps**: MLflow, Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD, Great Expectations, Evidently AI
- **Cloud**: AWS (SageMaker, Lambda, Glue, Athena), Azure (Azure ML, DevOps, AKS, Databricks)
- **Programming**: Python, SQL, Git, REST APIs, Jupyter
