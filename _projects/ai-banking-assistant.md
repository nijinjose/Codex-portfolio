## Why I Built This

Financial questions can be deeply personal. Using public chatbots means sharing sensitive financial details with third parties - something many people aren't comfortable with. I wanted to create a solution that gives people access to AI-powered financial guidance while keeping their personal information private.

## What It Does

I built a conversational AI assistant specifically for answering banking and financial questions. The interface is clean and simple - you type your question, and the assistant responds with helpful information about topics like:

- Investment strategies
- Budgeting advice
- Credit score improvement
- Basic tax questions
- Financial planning

The key difference from general-purpose chatbots is that this assistant is specialized for financial topics and designed with privacy in mind - it doesn't store conversation history beyond the current session.

## Technical Implementation

I used Gradio to create a lightweight web interface that anyone can run locally. Under the hood, it connects to xAI's Grok model via their API, which provides surprisingly nuanced responses to financial questions.

The application is deliberately designed as a local-first tool rather than a cloud service, reinforcing the privacy-focused approach.

## Technologies

- Python for the core application logic
- Gradio for creating an interactive web interface
- xAI's Grok LLM API for intelligent responses
- REST API integration for communicating with the model

What I enjoyed most about this project was finding the right balance between usability and privacy - making something powerful enough to be useful while respecting users' desire to keep financial matters confidential.
