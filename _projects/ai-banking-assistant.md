## Project Overview

Built an interactive web application using Gradio to provide a conversational interface for banking assistance. This project addresses the need for users to ask financial questions and receive intelligent guidance privately, without sharing sensitive personal data with a public chatbot.

The assistant integrates with xAI's Grok LLM via its API to understand user queries and provide relevant, informative responses regarding general banking topics and financial concepts.

## Technologies Used

*   Python
*   Gradio (for web interface)
*   Grok LLM API (xAI)
*   REST API integration
